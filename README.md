# Common_Core

42 is a school with a *different* approach. The school have campuses all around the world and believes in the peer-to-peer learning. This means that we have *no teachers* and we *learn* at the same time that we *teach*.
To enter at 42 school, we need to pass to a selective process called Piscine, that is a intensive training with the duration of 1 month.
At 42 we are rigorous at evaluations, this makes our learning process much more powerful and prepare us more effectivelly for job market.

Below I present some projects that I've been worked on so far on 42 Porto Common Core course. We use mostly C language.
